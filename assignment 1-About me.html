<p>My three favourite movies are:</p><h3>Avengers Endgame</h3><img src="Avengers Endgame.jpg" alt="Avengers second war/fight against Thanos">
<p>I love this movie. Most people do. I like this movie because its a marvel movie,and i like all marvel movies. I love the avengers so basically,any movie about them id watch it because its one of the biggest blockbusters in the world. I also like the characters based on the fact that they're superheroes and the storylines make sense.</p>
<h3>Escape from Pretoria</h3><img src="escape from pretoria.jpg" alt="its about racism in a sense"><p>So this movie is about a white guy who stands against racism and was thrown in proson because of that. so during his prison time he kept carving keys, keys to all the door locks in the prison so that one day,they'llunlock all and escait.pe. So this was a very interesting movie and i like the way the main character thinks </p>
<h3>The banker</h3><img src="the banker.jpg" alt="a movie about racism"><p>This movie was also about racism. A black man who went into real estate investments and becane a very rich "black" man. well all in all this movie was realy interesting and i enjoyed it</p>
