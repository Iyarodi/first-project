<body><p class="thenight"> On the night of 20 October 2020, at about 6:50 p.m. WAT, members of the Nigerian Armed Forces opened fire at peaceful End SARS protesters at the Lekki toll gate in Lagos, Nigeria.</p>
<img class="firstimage" src="img_Lekki tollgate massacre.jpg" alt="image of lekki massacre" width="240" height="240" style="float:left"/> <p class="stuff">According to Amnesty International, shortly before the shooting, CCTV cameras were allegedly removed from the toll gate.  subsequently said these were laser cameras and not CCTV cameras as earlier publicized on social media.[21] In addition, the electricity supplying lights to the toll gate was cut and the advertisement billboards, which are owned and maintained by Loatsad Media, were turned off.[3] Loatsad Media stated, "On Tuesday [20 October] when the cur
few was announced we heeded the governors warnings and didn't want our staff in any danger, hence by 3 p.m. our staff had been ordered to leave the site and the board was switched off based on the governors curfew request."[22] Protesters who used MTN and Airtel as their network providers reported that network antennas in that area had been switched off, leaving them unable to make phone calls or use the internet. MTN Nigeria apologised later that night for the loss of coverage at the time of the shooting.[3]</p>

<p class="lastlast">As of 2015, only phase 1 of the project had been completed, with phase 2 nearing completion. The peninsula is approximately 70 to 80 km long, with an average width of 10 km. Lekki currently houses several gated residential developments, agricultural farmlands, areas allocated for a Free Trade Zone, with an airport, and a sea port under construction. The proposed land-use master plan for the Lekki envisages the Peninsula as a "Blue-Green Environment City",[2] expected to accommodate well over 3.4 million residential population and an additional non-residential population of at least 1.9 million.</p>
