<img class="firstimage" src="img_Lekki tollgate massacre.jpg" alt="massacre of innocent civilians by soldiers at Lekki tollgate"> <div class="three"three> On the night of 20 October 2020, Nigerian Armed Forces shot at unarmed protesters at the Lekki toll gate in Lagos, Nigeria.[20]

According to Amnesty International, shortly before the shooting, CCTV cameras were allegedly removed from the toll gate.  subsequently said these were laser cameras and not CCTV cameras as earlier publicized on social media.[21] In addition, the electricity supplying lights to the toll gate was cut and the advertisement billboards, which are owned and maintained by Loatsad Media, were turned off.[3] Loatsad Media stated, "On Tuesday [20 October] when the curfew was announced we heeded the governors warnings and didn't want our staff in any danger, hence by 3 p.m. our staff had been ordered to leave the site and the board was switched off based on the governors curfew request."[22] Protesters who used MTN and Airtel as their network providers reported that network antennas in that area had been switched off, leaving them unable to make phone calls or use the internet. MTN Nigeria apologised later that night for the loss of coverage at the time of the shooting.[3]</div>
